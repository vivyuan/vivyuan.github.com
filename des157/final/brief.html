    <h1>Project Brief</h1>

    <div>

        <h2>Project Summary</h2>
            <p>I am going to further develop my Mad Libs project by adjusting layout, adding 
                overlay, better images and return functions to complete the process. 
            </p>

        <h2>Comparison Project 1</h2>
            <p>Here is a <a href="http://articulate-heroes-authoring.s3.amazonaws.com/Examples/Storyline/SL2/Mad%20Libs%20-%20Gomez/story_html5.html">Mad Libs project</a> 
                shared by Alyssa Gomez that I found in an article on E-Learning Heroes. I thought this site would be my goal for the revision of my Mad Libs project. 
                The content on this Vday Mad Libs is very concise and it does not occupy a lot of space. I also really like the graphics which are nicely done. Furthermore, 
                the website includes a reset button after the result came out which is one of my main goals. One thing could be improved on this project is that a better 
                font could be chosen. Overall, this website is where I want to go at the end of the project.
            </p>

        <h2>Comparison Project 2</h2>
            <p>Here is another <a href="https://360.articulate.com/review/content/79bb2267-81fd-4c77-9408-73b5bc8c4f7c/review">Mad Libs example</a> created by David Anderson. 
                I really like Andersonâ€™s concept in which it generates the words in a quote at the end. The 
                color choices are great and match the minimalistic style and plain white background. In my perspective, the typography is perfect. The texts are displayed 
                in a very organized and eye-catching way. One thing that could be improved is that the preset text in the form could be a lighter color instead of keeping 
                it the same color as the input. Additionally, I think it is a great idea that Anderson used an icon for the reset function and I will try to implement this 
                idea into my design. Overall, I love the effectiveness of the interface and interactions.
            </p>

        <h2>Project Goals</h2>
            <p>My goals for the revision of the Mad Libs project are to refine the images by making an image or some thumbnails that can match the interface better, add a 
                reset function possibly replace the text with an icon that I made by myself. Furthermore, I will make adjustments to the styling based on the feedback that 
                I received from my peers such as add paddings and preset text. Right now my Mad libs presents all content in only one slide, my revised project is going to 
                look more similar to the two comparison projects I introduced previously and have an overlay function.
            </p>

        <h2>Design Strategies</h2>
            <p>For the overall look and feel, I am going to keep the color choices and background colors because the neon colors look very nice. Though I am going to modify 
                the font and font size, image sizes, text spacing and so on. I will also rearrange the order of the content and try to make the game smaller on the page and 
                centered on the screen. Besides, I will add a mobile version to it so that it could be responsive and complete. As I mentioned above, I want to use a reset 
                icon on the button to replace the reset text which I think is going to look modern and give the game  a more interactive feel.
            </p>

        <h2>Interactionn Strategies</h2>
            <p>The interaction strategies I have are to create an overlay function for the result as well as including a reset button so that users can go back to the start 
                of the game instead of refreshing the page. I am also thinking about adding a clear form function just in case users made mistakes in typing and want to start 
                over. Another interaction strategy I am planning to do is to add a time-based function where the result page automatically returns to the start. However, I am 
                not sure how it would affect user experience so I might not include this function eventually.
            </p>

        <h2>Experience Goals</h2>
            <p>In order to achieve my goals, I will need to spend more time on developing cooler graphics to match the theme of my Mad Libs. Since the theme is related to 
                fashion and party, my audience would be the younger generation and mostly teenagers and young adults. Hence I am planning on making some cute graphics in a 
                smaller form so that they can be placed on the website in an organized way. To make the revision Mad Libs more fun, I can add a sound effect so that it gives 
                feedback to the users when they interact with the buttons.
            </p>
