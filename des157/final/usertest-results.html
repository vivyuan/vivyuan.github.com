    <h1>User Test Results</h1>

    <div>
        <h2>Observations</h2>
            <p> My first participant understood how to navigate through the process right away after seeing the user tasks. 
                I noticed that his input matches the pre-fill texts exactly which is great meaning that users will have more 
                accurate results once they submit. The first participant completed the test quickly and smoothly without thinking 
                for too long. The participant was satisfied with the result and the design but did not have an opinion on the 
                content. The participant seemed happy with the design, typography and the content. The participant suggested 
                bringing the background image brighter and I provided an explanation for making the illustration dark. The 
                participant understood and agreed with my perspectives.
            </p>

            <p>My second participant followed the tasks and interacted with the images, completed the form and saw the results. 
                However, the participant skipped the second task which is to reset the input. Hence I figured it might be a better 
                way to change the text “reset” to “clear” so it makes more sense to the users. The second participant also claimed 
                that the background images are difficult to see. I provided the same explanation and was thinking that I should 
                increase the brightness of the background images a little bit. The participant claimed that the glowing effect 
                on the title works really well.
            </p>

            <p>My third participant went through the entire process in the correct order smoothly. The participant mentioned 
                the effectiveness of using animations. One problem that the participant found is that the default browser text 
                box covers the animated text box while user types and provided a solution by changing the default on HTML which 
                was extremely helpful. The participant also provided opinions on whether I should add background music to the 
                website and which types of music I should add. The user suggested chill edm types of music just to make the 
                website more interesting while not driving the attention away from the users.
            </p>
        

        <h2>Plans</h2>
            <p>Based on all the feedback that I received from the participants, I am going to change some of the texts so that 
                they are easier to understand. I am also going to add background music, possibly making it play only when the 
                results come out. I will also try to increase the brightness of the background images and see if it decreases 
                the readability of other content. If it does, I will leave them what they were before. 
            </p>
