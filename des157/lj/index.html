                </h3>
                    <p>I chose to read Naema Baskanderi’s article “Best Practices for Modals/Overlays/Dialog Windows” because 
                        I found the other article’s typography and layout is more difficult for me to read. In Baskanderi’s 
                        article, though some of the sentences are not separated by commas, I found the content is interesting 
                        and worth reading. Something that I was not aware of before reading this article is that the sizing and 
                        the placement of the modals/overlay/dialog windows. I strongly agree with the suggestions which are to 
                        place the overlay on the “upper half of the screen” and “do not use more than 50% of the screen for the 
                        overlay.” (2017). I have used overlay windows in some of my UI designs but I never paid much attention 
                        to the placement of text, sizing, and location - I was more likely just to measure by my own eyes. 
                        Now that I learned Baskanderi’s suggestions and understood the explanations, I will always apply these 
                        recommendations to my design principles.

                </h3>
                    <p>I totally agree with what the article is saying - to design a most user-friendly interface, we need 
                        to stick with the principles of “less is more”. When asking questions and designing the layout, it 
                        is always better to display the minimum texts needed and use a simpler layout such as choosing one 
                        column instead of two. The concept that the article “Best Practices for Form Design” is trying to 
                        illustrate is similar to Hick’s Law, which is the principle that I always think of when creating 
                        digital content. Besides, I like how this article breaks down the design process in detail to enable 
                        me to catch little things that I never noticed before such as the “optional and required fields”. 
                        Furthermore, I learned that making a form tab-ready is essential to maximizing a user’s experience. 
                        Overall, this article is very helpful for me when it comes to designing a form for users to complete.
