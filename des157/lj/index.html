                    <p>Before reading the article “Game Design UX Best Practices” by Amir Dori, I always thought that to design a game is 
                        complicated and nothing that I am learning is related to it. However, Dori’s article shifted my mind. In fact, game 
                        design is just what I am learning but aiming at strategies in UI/UX that are designed for smaller screens! I enjoy 
                        the details that Dori covers in his article such as the UI positions, sliders, and pop-up because I have been working 
                        on those recently but on a larger screen. Compare game design to web design, what made it more complicated are the 
                        constraints of device size. It is so impressive to see how designers use different strategies and ideas to overcome 
                        the obstacles.

                            I found this image in my sunglasses collection the most interesting one because its bright yellow color not 
                            only matches every background color but also gives a beautiful contrast and detailing of the object itself. 
                            I like how the shadowing lines came out organized and simple. Many other images of my sunglasses collection 
                            are in black color so I think this yellow sunglasses is going to stand out and bring in some warmth to the 
                            screen. The shape of the image is symmetrical and well balanced as well. In my collection for the Every Picture 
                            project, this image weights the same as the others and is considered as one of the sunglasses I have. Even though 
                            this image is like every other image, I think its uniqueness is going to make it everyone’s favorite of my 
                            sunglasses collection. When I finish my collection for this project, I think everyone is going to be able to 
                            understand my fashion styles and imagine how the sunglasses are going to look on me.

                        <p>
                            This image above belongs to my group mate, Caroline Yau. She claimed that this image is one of her favorite 
                            drawings from her portfolio. She also mentions that for the Every Picture project, she is going to make a slideshow 
                            of her portfolio art works. I found Caroline’s art extremely beautiful according to its compositions, choice of 
                            colors, shadowing, and cleanness. The Image almost looked alive to me. Furthermore, Caroline illustrated the character 
                            so well that the art is sending various emotions to the audience. The color blends and content gives a relaxing vibe 
                            and is very inspirational. The most obvious aspect of this image is that the character is relexing on the grass and 
                            the most mysterious aspect of this image is that the audience may not tell whether the character is in a great mood. 
                            I am exited to see Caroline’s final version of her Every Picture project.

                    <p>I enjoy looking at the website <a href="http://pierrehermenicolasbuffe.com/en">Pierre Herme Nicolas Buffe</a> not 
                        only because it has consistent, simple but unique graphics but also the interactions created. When I enter the 
                        website, there is mysterious graphic design with a paragraph introducing the story inside of it. Once I start 
                        the story, the first page I see is a simple intruction on how to navigate the site - by dragging the button to 
                        continue. When I arrive at the main page, I can explore the story by interacting with the images that are in a 
                        circle, and the story starts telling from there. There is also a background music that is very pleasing. To keep 
                        reading the story, I can simply drag the button which I think is great to keep the interaction consistent so that 
                        the users know what they are doing.

                </h3>
                    <p>I chose to read Naema Baskanderi’s article “Best Practices for Modals/Overlays/Dialog Windows” because 
                        I found the other article’s typography and layout is more difficult for me to read. In Baskanderi’s 
                        article, though some of the sentences are not separated by commas, I found the content is interesting 
                        and worth reading. Something that I was not aware of before reading this article is that the sizing and 
                        the placement of the modals/overlay/dialog windows. I strongly agree with the suggestions which are to 
                        place the overlay on the “upper half of the screen” and “do not use more than 50% of the screen for the 
                        overlay.” (2017). I have used overlay windows in some of my UI designs but I never paid much attention 
                        to the placement of text, sizing, and location - I was more likely just to measure by my own eyes. 
                        Now that I learned Baskanderi’s suggestions and understood the explanations, I will always apply these 
                        recommendations to my design principles.

                </h3>
                    <p>I totally agree with what the article is saying - to design a most user-friendly interface, we need 
                        to stick with the principles of “less is more”. When asking questions and designing the layout, it 
                        is always better to display the minimum texts needed and use a simpler layout such as choosing one 
                        column instead of two. The concept that the article “Best Practices for Form Design” is trying to 
                        illustrate is similar to Hick’s Law, which is the principle that I always think of when creating 
                        digital content. Besides, I like how this article breaks down the design process in detail to enable 
                        me to catch little things that I never noticed before such as the “optional and required fields”. 
                        Furthermore, I learned that making a form tab-ready is essential to maximizing a user’s experience. 
                        Overall, this article is very helpful for me when it comes to designing a form for users to complete.
