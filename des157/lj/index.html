                </h3>
                    <p>I totally agree with what the article is saying - to design a most user-friendly interface, we need 
                        to stick with the principles of “less is more”. When asking questions and designing the layout, it 
                        is always better to display the minimum texts needed and use a simpler layout such as choosing one 
                        column instead of two. The concept that the article “Best Practices for Form Design” is trying to 
                        illustrate is similar to Hick’s Law, which is the principle that I always think of when creating 
                        digital content. Besides, I like how this article breaks down the design process in detail to enable 
                        me to catch little things that I never noticed before such as the “optional and required fields”. 
                        Furthermore, I learned that making a form tab-ready is essential to maximizing a user’s experience. 
                        Overall, this article is very helpful for me when it comes to designing a form for users to complete.
